I'm happily a part-timer for [DefendOps](https://defendops.com) as a Backend Developer and a System Administrator,
and [Cydista](https://cydista.com) as a Backend developer and a Team leader.

Some of the projects I worked on:

[Mokine](#) [INTERNAL] (Backend): an animal tracking internal application for a farm It uses a chip to track down the health and location of the animals to warn the owners If it goes out of boundaries.

[Easycast](#) [INTERNAL] (Backend): an internal application used by directors for cenamtic compaines.

[SAAR](#) [DISCONTINUED] (Backend and mobile application): SAAR is a mobile app used for transporting items and relocating homes.

[TGBoost](https://tgboost.com) (Backend): a game elo boosting service platform

I used ASP.NET Core Web API as a backend for all of them.

most of the projects I worked on I have no permission to share any details about them.
