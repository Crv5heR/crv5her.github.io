I'm a 20 year old backend developer, server administrator and sometimes a team leader, puter wizard from Cairo, Egypt

I started learning to code when I was 9yo to create Minecraft plugins using Java, and since then I started taking it more seriously and made a fair number of projects for clients I would never have thought Iâ€™d work with.

Now, I work as a ASP.NET Backend Developer
